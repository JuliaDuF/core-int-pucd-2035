<p>I'm a student at Parsons School of Design and I'm majoring in Communication Design. I think that the work of a designer is majorly based on his or her life experiences. Through each design, we may see the designer's understanding toward him or her self influenced by the cultural surroundings. Therefore I also believe that designers are responsible for not only reflecting the current society, but also their work shall influence the next generation in a comprehensive and positive way.</p>

<p>My family loves to travel during the vacations so I've got the chance of visiting many countires since I was a child. I love collecting key chains through my trips and I made a board of collection in my room. Throughout these trips I was fascinated by the differences in culture and art in all different parts of the world, which motivated me to study abroad after middleschool. I still keep the habit of buying keychains today when I go to a city or a musuem that I've never been to. Looking at the collection board helps me to bring up the memories that I had during those trips and thus giving me insiprations for future designs.</p>
